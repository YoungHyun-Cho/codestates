A total of 52 male and female subjects were recruited and classified into four groups by gender and obesity based on the fat percentage of 25% and 30% for men and women, respectively. Cutaneous warm and cold sensitivity was measured on ten body regions, using a method of limit together with the measurements of regional skinfold thickness. The results indicated no significant interaction between gender and obesity while women exhibiting a higher sensitivity to both cold and warm stimuli than men. However, thermal sensitivity was not significantly associated with skinfold thickness on most regions of the body in men and women. In conclusion, women were more sensitive to both cold and warm stimuli than men. Obesity and local subcutaneous fat appeared not to influence regional thermal sensitivity. Further research is warranted to confirm the effects of obesity and local subcutaneous fat on regional thermal sensitivity. Thermal sensations arise in response to relatively small temperature changes at the body surface; depending on their direction, these changes are perceived as warming or cooling (Hensel, 1973). The specificity theory of somesthesis (Boring, 1942) holds that perceptions of cold and warm are served by separate senses. Indeed, these perceptions appear to rely on separate neural pathways involving thin myelinated or unmyelinated axons of the peripheral nervous system (Hensel, 1974, Hensel et al., 1974). The unmyelinated terminal branches of these axons have no identifiable corpuscle, are implemented in the basal layer of the dermis, and constitute the receptive organs of thermal perception The existence of two separate populations of thermoreceptors was first demonstrated in the 19th century by Blix (1884) and Von Frey (1895) in their studies on cutaneous sensory spots. Subsequently, Zotterman (1959) showed that cold receptor endings lie within 0.15 mm of the dermis, whereas warm receptor endings are buried more deeply, at 0.6 mm. In addition to being closer to the surface, cold receptors are also three to ten times more numerous than warm receptors across the majority of body regions (Guyton, 1991). This difference in density and depth probably explains why humans have a generally higher sensitivity to cold. The specific properties of the thermal receptors were demonstrated in the 1960s and 1970s in electrophysiological studies on primary afferent nerve fibers in humans (Hensel and Boman, 1960, Konietzny and Hensel, 1975, Konietzny and Hensel, 1977) and animals (Duclaux and Kenshalo, 1980, Iggo, 1959, Kenshalo et al., 1976, Kenshalo and Duclaux, 1977). The frequencies of action-potential discharge for these receptors were shown to vary by skin temperature, with cold receptors selectively responding to stimuli over a wide range of 10–40 °C, while warm receptors responded to temperatures between 32 °C and 45 °C. Both receptor types have peak firing rates, but the fibers vary in their discharge patterns, giving rise to considerable variation in the temperature at which peak firing is observed. Moreover, some cold receptor populations show a secondary firing rate increase at high temperatures (above 45 °C); this may explain why some hot stimuli induce paradoxically cold sensations. Between 30 °C and 40 °C, the temperature to which human thermal receptors are most frequently exposed, an increase in skin temperature raises the discharge frequency of warm sensors while decreasing the frequency of action potentials from cold sensors. Conversely, a skin temperature decrease has the opposite effect on firing rates. When the skin temperature is kept at about 32–34 °C, there is no thermal perception and this range is referred to as the ‘neutral temperature range’. Moreover, the thermal sensations adapt completely, given time, i.e., the sensation entirely disappears. The time required for receptors to adapt completely is inversely related to how close the temperature deviation (or ‘adapting temperature’) is to the limits of the neutral temperature range (Kenshalo, 1990).";
